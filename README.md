# Note Taker

## Description 

This application allows users to create and save notes to their desire. 
For this project-- the front-end was already built, and I was tasked to set up the back-end via Express.js and complementary server side code. 

Once the user "saves" a new note-- that data will persist through POSTs to a server built with Express, and hosted on Heroku. 
The user may go back to read any previously saved notes through GET requests to said server.

## Installation
To install dependencies, run the following command:
```
npm install
```

## Utilized technologies 

This application was built using __JavaScript__.

In order to bring additional functionality to the project the following packages/technologies were implemented:
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Heroku

## Challenges

This was my first attempt at instantiating a server and-- while the JS methods were easy enough to implement-- the logic/foundation of server-client communication was difficult at first to conceptualize. However woking through this project gave me a rewarding "eureka" moment of how to approach applications moving forward. It seems as if JS is just a series of "modules" whether it be the code I write or import, and as long as I can understand what certain modules will "expect" as an input & "return" as an output-- _the sky is the limit_.

I still have much to learn both up & down the "full-stack", but I enjoyed this new challenge and look forward to the eventual database queries to come!
